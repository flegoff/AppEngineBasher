= AppEngineBasher

A quick and dirty bash.org clone for AppEngine. Deployment is quite
easy and really quick : you just have to upload the repository's files
to your AppEngine instance.

The project files may be downloaded here :
 - http://github.com/madflo/AppEngineBasher/archives/master

Do not forget to insert your JID in "basher.yaml" and customize
"templates/common/header.html". Then, you will be all set !

== Adding a quote

 Talk to yourinstance@appspot.com via Jabber or GTalk

 yourinstance is the name of your appengine instance, the part of
 the domain located before .appspot.com.

== Admin

 Log-in on /admin with a developer account registered in the AppEngine
 dashboard (Administration > Developers). New admins should be added
 in the appengine dashboard first.
